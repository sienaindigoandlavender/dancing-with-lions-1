          <Prose>The Kebra Nagast is not history. It is political theology. And it is extraordinarily good at what it does.</Prose>
          <Prose>A single narrative unified dozens of ethnic groups across one of the most geographically diverse territories on earth for seven centuries. A mythological bloodline provided legitimacy that no military conquest alone could sustain. A sacred object gave Ethiopia a unique position in Christian theology. A boy's journey — his refusal to stay in Jerusalem, his choice to return home — encoded the principle that Ethiopian sovereignty is not derivative.</Prose>
          <Prose>This is why Menelik II named himself after Menelik I. This is why Haile Selassie wrote his descent into the constitution. This is why the Rastafari movement sees Haile Selassie as the returned Messiah and Ethiopia as the promised land. The story has an extraordinary ability to absorb new meanings while maintaining its central claim: Ethiopia is chosen.</Prose>
