In a landscape with no trees, no fences, no buildings — the stacked stone becomes the human proxy. A distinct form, the inunnguaq, is shaped like a human figure with arms, legs, and a head. But most inuksuit are simpler: directional pointers, cache markers, warnings. About 100 inuksuit on Foxe Peninsula, Baffin Island, are 2,000+ years old and still standing.

When Tibetan Buddhism arrived, the tradition absorbed Buddhist elements without losing its shamanic core. Travellers circle an ovoo three times clockwise, adding a stone each time and leaving offerings — blue silk, horse skulls, vodka. Some ovoo complexes contain 7 to 13 cairns in formation, the largest in the centre. In a 2013 survey, 75 of 144 Mongolian respondents said they believe in ovoo ceremonies.',

The cairns grow over centuries as each traveller adds to the collective prayer.

Coastal cairns, painted white for visibility, guided ships through island-strewn waters — still maintained today as part of the nautical marking system. Mountain varder mark trails above the treeline where snow obliterates paths for months. Iceland, with almost no trees, uses cairns extensively.

Those who returned removed their stone. The remaining stones became a cairn for the dead. In Ireland, it is traditional to carry a stone from the bottom of a hill to place on the summit cairn.

Hikers add stones to existing cairns at peaks and passes, trying to balance one more stone on top for good luck.

Its Aramaic equivalent, Yegar Sahaduta, means the same thing. In modern Hebrew, gal-ed is still the word for cairn.

Over centuries, it evolved into the elaborate hemispherical and spired structures found from Sri Lanka to Japan. But the origin is the same universal act: pile stones over the dead, mark the place, make it sacred.

          <Prose>In the High Atlas, you see them on passes. Small pyramids of stacked stone, sometimes with a stick or a rag tied to the top. They mark the trail where there are no signs. They mark graves where there are no headstones. They mark the boundary between one tribe's territory and the next. The Amazigh call them kerkour.</Prose>
          <Prose>In the Canadian Arctic, the Inuit build inuksuit — stone figures that "act in the capacity of a human." They point toward caribou hunting grounds, mark safe passages across the tundra, store messages between families. Some on Baffin Island are 4,000 years old.</Prose>
          <Prose>In Mongolia, travellers circle ovoo cairns three times clockwise, adding a stone and leaving offerings of blue silk for the sky spirits. In the Andes, Quechua pilgrims place stones on apachetas at high passes with coca leaf prayers. In Scotland, Highland warriors piled stones before battle and removed them after — the unclaimed stones became the memorial. In Korea, hikers stack stones at mountain peaks for the Mountain Spirit. In Genesis 31, Jacob and Laban built a cairn as a covenant witness — gal-ed, "heap of testimony."</Prose>
          <Prose>None of these peoples are connected. The Inuit and the Amazigh have never met. The Mongols and the Quechua share no ancestor for 15,000 years. The Scottish and the Korean traditions evolved on opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass with no contact whatsoever.</Prose>
          <Prose>This is not a connection. This is convergence. The same problem, solved the same way, independently, across five continents, for at least 8,000 years. The problem: a treeless landscape, loose stone, and the need to say something to the next person who passes.</Prose>

          <Title>Not a connection. A proof.</Title>
          <Prose>When you see a kerkour in the Atlas and think of an inuksuk in the Arctic, the temptation is to look for a link. A migration, a shared ancestor, a lost connection between peoples. The human mind craves narrative. We want the story to be about contact.</Prose>
          <Prose>But the real story is better. The real story is that human beings, independently, on every continent, in every era, when confronted with the same conditions — treeless terrain, loose stone, the need to speak to someone who is not yet there — arrive at the same answer. Stack rocks. Make a vertical mark on a horizontal world. Say: I was here. The trail is this way. The dead are underneath. The spirits are above. Keep going.</Prose>
          <Prose>The stone language is not learned. It is not transmitted. It is not inherited. It is invented, again and again, because it is the only possible solution to the problem of being human in a landscape that offers nothing but rock and sky.</Prose>
          <Prose>That is more interesting than a connection. That is a universal.</Prose>
