    note: 'The largest lion subspecies in recorded history. Males weighed up to 300 kg with dark manes extending over belly and between hind legs. Hunted by Romans for Colosseum spectacles — thousands were captured and shipped across the Mediterranean. The Moroccan royal family kept lions as symbols of power for centuries; Berber tribes presented captured lions to sultans as pledges of loyalty. When the royal family was exiled in 1953, 21 lions were transferred to zoos in Rabat and Casablanca. These "Royal Lions" are now the only known descendants.',
    keyFact: 'The last confirmed wild Barbary lion was shot in the Atlas Mountains in 1922 by a French colonial hunter. But research published in PLoS ONE (2013) found eyewitness accounts suggesting lions survived in remote areas until the 1960s — possibly as late as 1965 in Algeria.',

The last known specimen was likely killed in the Tetouan area of the Rif Mountains around 1870, though some accounts suggest a few survived into the 1890s.',

              <p className="text-[15px] text-dwl-gray mt-6 leading-relaxed">
                The Barbary lion was not just a predator. It was the symbol of North African
                power for three thousand years. Nubian deities wore its face. Roman emperors
                filled colosseums with its rage. Moroccan sultans kept it behind palace walls
                as proof of divine authority. The football team still carries its name.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[15px] text-dwl-gray mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                What killed it was not spectacular. Deforestation of the Atlas Mountains for timber and
                agriculture shrank its range decade by decade. The arrival of modern firearms in the 19th
                century made what remained a target. French colonial hunters treated it as a trophy.
                By 1922, the gunshot that killed the last confirmed wild lion echoed through empty cedar forests.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="text-[15px] text-dwl-gray leading-relaxed">
                But the story has a strange coda. When Morocco&apos;s royal family was exiled in 1953,
                twenty-one lions from the palace collection were transferred to zoos. These &ldquo;Royal Lions&rdquo;
                — descendants of animals that Berber tribes had presented to sultans as pledges of loyalty —
                carried genetics that may be the last link to the wild Barbary population.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[15px] text-dwl-gray mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                Today, the Rabat Zoo houses 32 of approximately 90 Royal Barbary lions known worldwide.
                A studbook tracks every descendant. European zoos in Germany, Czech Republic, Switzerland,
                and the UK run coordinated breeding programmes. The Atlas Lion Project proposes eventual
                reintroduction to the wild — a return to the mountains — though it remains unfunded and controversial.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[15px] text-dwl-gray mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                And then there are the eyewitnesses. A 2013 study in PLoS ONE interviewed elderly
                residents of remote Algerian communities who described seeing lions well after 1922.
                Statistical modelling placed the probable extinction date in Morocco at 1948 — possibly
                as late as the 1960s. The last mountain forests near Algeria&apos;s coast were destroyed
                during the French-Algerian War. The lions, if any still lived, would have burned with the trees.

When the royal family was exiled in 1953, the lions were parcelled off to zoos as afterthoughts. Decades later, scientists realised these 21 animals carried the last known Barbary genetics. A captive population of about 90 lions now exists because of political exile and zoo transfers — the most accidental conservation programme in history.',
