    name: 'Guembri',
    aliases: ['Sintir', 'Hajhouj', 'Gimbri'],
    arabic: 'الكمبري / سنتير',
    description: 'Three-stringed bass plucked lute. Only played by the maalem (master musician). Guitar-sized, with a body carved from a single log and covered with camel skin.',
    materials: 'Body: single piece of walnut, mahogany, poplar, fig, acacia, or iroko wood, hollowed out. Soundboard: dromedary (camel) neck skin, stretched taut and nailed or stitched. Strings: three strings of goat gut (modern: sometimes nylon). Tuning: sliding leather rings. Sound modifier: sersera — metal rings attached to neck that create a distinctive buzzing rattle.',
    construction: 'Body hollowed from a halved tree trunk into a rectangular or canoe shape. Camel skin stretched over the playing side, functioning like a banjo membrane. The neck passes through the body, emerging through the skin at the base as a string carrier. Three strings of different thickness: the lowest is a drone (never fretted), the middle tuned an octave higher (also a drone, half-neck length), the highest is melodic. Approximately 1.2m total length; box approximately 55cm × 19cm × 14cm.',
    playing: 'Strings plucked downward with knuckle side of index finger and inside of thumb. The player simultaneously slaps the camel skin body with free fingers for percussive tones — pizzicato cello meets hand drum. Both melodic and percussive at once. Common tunings: C, D, F, G. Pentatonic scales predominate.',
    role: 'Attracts the mluk (spirits) into the dance space and drives trance. Only the maalem plays it. In the lila, the guembri opens the treq (path) — the encoded sequence of ritual repertoire.',
    ancestor: 'Derived from the West African ngoni (4-stringed lute of the Sahel griots). Also related to the xalam and hoddu. The sliding leather tuning rings and percussive playing style are directly traceable to Malian and Sahelian instruments. Some scholars draw connections to the American banjo through shared African ancestry.',

  {
    name: 'Qraqeb',
    aliases: ['Krakebs', 'Karkabat', 'Chkacheks'],
    arabic: 'قراقب',
    description: 'Large iron castanets in a figure-8 shape. Played by the ensemble (kouyou) accompanying the maalem.',
    materials: 'Forged iron or steel. Two pairs of concave metal discs connected by a curved handle. Heavy — the weight is part of the sound.',
    construction: 'Each castanet is two metal shells joined at one end. The player holds one pair in each hand. When struck together, they produce a sharp, penetrating, metallic clap.',
    playing: 'Played with both hands simultaneously, marking and maintaining constant binary and tertiary rhythms that overlap and alternate. The qraqeb keep a relentless, incisive rhythm throughout the lila — they are the thread that places participants in the Gnawa universe. When not playing qraqeb, ensemble members clap.',
    role: 'The qraqeb maintain rhythmic foundation while the guembri leads melodically. Together they create the polyrhythmic 3:2 hemiola characteristic of trance music worldwide.',
    ancestor: 'No direct West African ancestor identified, but iron percussion instruments are widespread across the Sahel. The figure-8 shape may be unique to Gnawa adaptation in Morocco.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Tbel',
    aliases: ['Ganga', 'Tbal'],
    arabic: 'طبل',
    description: 'Large cylindrical drum. Used in the opening processional phase (aada) and in rural/Berber-influenced Gnawa styles.',
    materials: 'Wooden shell with goatskin heads on both sides. Struck with curved sticks.',
    construction: 'Double-headed drum, larger than most Moroccan percussion. Carried on a strap or placed on the ground.',
    playing: 'Struck with curved sticks on both heads. Creates deep, resonant, processional beats. In urban lila ceremonies, the tbel is used primarily in the opening aada phase, then set aside when the guembri takes over for the treq.',
    role: 'Opens the ceremony. In rural areas (particularly Berber-influenced regions), the ganga/tbel has greater prominence. In urban imperial cities (Marrakech, Fez, Essaouira), the guembri dominates. This urban/rural distinction marks two broad Gnawa stylistic traditions.',
    ancestor: 'Related to West African djembe and dundun drum traditions.',
