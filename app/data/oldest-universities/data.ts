    name: 'Al-Qarawiyyin',
    arabic: 'جامعة القرويين',
    location: 'Fez Medina, Morocco',
    founded: '857–859 CE (Ramadan 245 AH)',
    founder: 'Fatima al-Fihri (c. 800–880 CE) — daughter of wealthy Tunisian merchant Mohammed al-Fihri, who migrated from Kairouan to Fez',
    status: 'Guinness World Record: oldest existing, continually operating educational institution. UNESCO World Heritage (as part of Medina of Fez, 1981). Incorporated into modern state university system 1963. Five campuses today: Fez (×2), Marrakech, Agadir, Tetouan',
    detail: 'Founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri, who used her entire inheritance to build a place of worship and learning for the Qayrawaniyyin community. Her sister Mariam built the Al-Andalus Mosque across the river. Construction took ~2 years. Fatima fasted daily throughout construction. The institution evolved from mosque to madrasa to university over centuries. At its zenith (13th–14th C, under the Marinids), hundreds of students attended, supported by dozens of surrounding madrasas. The library once held 30,000+ volumes. Subjects expanded from Quran, hadith, and fiqh to include mathematics, astronomy, medicine, grammar, logic, and philosophy. The ijazah system (licence to teach a subject after demonstrating mastery) prefigured the modern degree. Non-Muslims attended — Maimonides, Gerbert d\'Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II). Today concentrates on Islamic sciences, Maliki law, and Classical Arabic.',
    keyFact: 'Founded by a woman 229 years before Bologna and 237 years before Oxford',

    name: 'Ben Youssef Madrasa',
    arabic: 'مدرسة ابن يوسف',
    location: 'Marrakech Medina, Morocco',
    founded: 'First madrasa on site: c. 1340 (Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan). Current building: 1564–65 CE (Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib)',
    founder: 'Marinid dynasty (original). Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib (reconstruction)',
    status: 'Historical site since 1960 closure. Reopened to public 1982. Restored 2018–2022. Major tourist attraction. No longer active as educational institution',
    detail: 'Named after the adjacent mosque founded by Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf (r. 1106–1142). The largest Islamic college in the Maghreb at its height — 130 dormitory rooms, up to 900 students from across North Africa and beyond. The current Saadian building replaced the Marinid original entirely. A masterpiece of Saadian architecture: zellige tilework, carved stucco, muqarnas, painted cedar, arabesques. The student cells are stark — decoration lavished on the courtyard and prayer hall. An 11th-century marble basin from Madinat al-Zahra (Córdoba, Spain) is on display — likely imported by Ali ibn Yusuf in the 12th century. Inscription above gateway: "You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded."',
    keyFact: '900 students in 130 rooms — and the inscription promised their highest hopes would be exceeded',

  { claim: 'Oldest continuously operating educational institution', forMorocco: 'Guinness World Records and UNESCO recognise Al-Qarawiyyin as "the oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world." Founded 859 CE. Teaching has occurred continuously since.', counterArgument: 'Many scholars argue that Al-Qarawiyyin was effectively a madrasa (Islamic college) until WWII, not a "university" in the European sense. The modern concept of a university — with faculties, autonomous governance, degree-granting structures — is a distinctly European innovation (Bologna, 1088).' },
  { claim: 'Mosque vs. university', forMorocco: 'Mosques in the Islamic world were always multi-functional: worship, education, political discussion, social gathering. The distinction between "mosque" and "university" is a Western categorisation that doesn\'t map onto Islamic educational traditions.', counterArgument: 'A foundation inscription discovered on-site dates to 877 CE and credits Dawud ibn Idris, not Fatima al-Fihri. Historian Chafik Benchekroun argues Fatima may be a legendary figure. The evidence is contested.' },
  { claim: 'Degree system (ijazah)', forMorocco: 'Al-Qarawiyyin pioneered the ijazah — a licence granted after demonstrating mastery of a subject. This system prefigured the modern degree and was adopted across the Islamic world centuries before European equivalents.', counterArgument: 'The ijazah was granted by individual scholars to individual students, not by an institution. It lacked the corporate, institutional character of European university degrees (Bologna\'s legal studium, Oxford\'s papal charter).' },
  { claim: 'The Encyclopædia Britannica position', forMorocco: 'Britannica dates Al-Qarawiyyin\'s foundation to 859 and generally considers that "universities" existed outside Europe before the European model.', counterArgument: 'UNESCO itself describes Bologna (1088) as the "oldest university of the Western world" — implicitly acknowledging a different tradition. The debate is partly semantic, partly structural.' },
