After 1689, ruled by elected deys — a military republic answering only loosely to Istanbul. At its peak, Algiers held 25,000 Christian captives and its corsairs raided as far as Iceland (1627). French invasion ended it in 1830.' },

    story: 'Conquered by Selim I in 1517 after destroying the Mamluk Sultanate. Egypt became the Ottoman Empire\'s most profitable province — its grain fed the navy, its taxes filled the treasury. But the Mamluks never truly left: they reasserted control from within, running Egypt as a state-within-a-state until Napoleon arrived in 1798.' },

    story: 'Changed hands repeatedly between Spain and the Regency of Algiers. Spain held it from 1509 to 1708, briefly regained it 1732–1792, then sold it to the Deylik. Symbol of the century-long Ottoman-Habsburg contest for Mediterranean supremacy.' },

He defeats them at the Battle of the Pyramids but is stranded when Nelson destroys his fleet at the Battle of the Nile. The French are expelled by Anglo-Ottoman forces in 1801.

  { year: 1830, title: 'France Takes Algiers', territory: 'algiers',

          In 1516, two brothers from a Greek island captured Algiers. In 1517, an Ottoman
          sultan destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate and took Egypt. Within sixty years, the
          Ottoman Empire controlled the entire North African coast from the Nile to the
          Atlantic — except Morocco. The three Barbary Regencies of Algiers, Tunis,
          and Tripoli were nominally Ottoman provinces, but in practice they were
          semi-autonomous corsair states that elected their own rulers, raided European
          shipping, and conducted independent diplomacy. Istanbul collected tribute and
          provided legitimacy. The corsairs provided everything else. Morocco — protected
          by the Atlas Mountains, the Saadian dynasty&apos;s gunpowder army, and the religious
          authority of its sharifian sultans — remained the only North African state the
          Ottomans never conquered. The empire held its African territories for three
          centuries until European powers stripped them away: France took Algiers (1830),
          then Tunis (1881). Italy took Libya (1911). Egypt was already lost to Britain.

              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The corsair system</p>
              <p>The Ottoman Empire did not govern North Africa the way it governed the Balkans or Anatolia. The three Barbary Regencies — Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli — were corsair states first and Ottoman provinces second. Revenue came from raiding European shipping: capturing vessels, seizing cargo, and ransoming crews. At its peak in the 17th century, Algiers alone held an estimated 25,000 Christian captives. European powers signed treaties directly with the deys and beys, not with Istanbul. England, France, and the Netherlands all maintained consuls whose primary job was negotiating the release of prisoners.</p>

            <div>
              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>Why Morocco survived</p>
              <p>Four reasons. Geography: the Atlas Mountains and the Moulouya River created a natural defensive barrier. Military capability: the Saadians had gunpowder armies of their own, trained and equipped on Ottoman lines. Religious legitimacy: Morocco&apos;s sultans were sharifs — descendants of the Prophet Muhammad — giving them a spiritual authority the Ottoman sultan could not match in the western Maghreb. And diplomatic skill: Ahmad al-Mansur played Ottoman, Spanish, and English interests against each other, maintaining alliances with all while submitting to none.</p>

            <div>
              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The autonomy gradient</p>
              <p>Ottoman control was strongest in Egypt (direct governor, janissary garrison, regular tax remittance) and weakest at the western edge. Algiers elected its own ruler from 1689. Tunis was governed by a hereditary dynasty from 1705. Tripoli had its own dynasty from 1711. By the 18th century, all three regencies were independent in everything except the Friday prayer, which was still recited in the sultan&apos;s name. The Ottoman Empire in North Africa was less an empire than a franchise.</p>

            <div>
              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The Barbarossa brothers</p>
              <p>Oruç and Hayreddin Reis — sons of an Ottoman sipahi father and a Greek mother on the island of Lesbos — built the entire western Ottoman naval system. Oruç was captured by the Knights of St. John and spent three years chained to an oar before being ransomed. He and Hayreddin moved west, became corsair captains, captured Algiers, and established the base that would anchor Ottoman power in the Mediterranean for three centuries. Hayreddin was later appointed Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) of the entire Ottoman fleet — a Greek-born corsair commanding the world&apos;s most powerful navy.</p>

            <div>
              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The end</p>
              <p>European imperialism dismantled the system. France took Algiers in 1830 (ostensibly over a fly whisk). France took Tunis in 1881 (ostensibly over a border raid). Britain controlled Egypt from 1882. Italy took Libya in 1911. In each case, the Ottoman Empire was too weak to defend its African territories. The map of modern North Africa — four independent states where there were once four Ottoman provinces, plus Morocco, which was never conquered — still reflects the boundaries the corsairs drew.</p>
