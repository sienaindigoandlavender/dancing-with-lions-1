          Between 1130 and 1269, the Almohad caliphate controlled everything from the
          Sahara to the Tagus, from the Atlantic to Tripoli. They rejected the ornamental
          excess of their Almoravid predecessors and built instead with monumental restraint —
          enormous minarets, austere facades, horseshoe arches that framed emptiness as
          deliberately as they framed stone. Their three sister minarets — the Kutubiyya in
          Marrakech, the Giralda in Seville, the Hassan Tower in Rabat — still define the
          skylines of three cities in two countries on two continents.

              <p>The Kutubiyya minaret (Marrakech, before 1195), the Giralda (Seville, 1184–1198), and the Hassan Tower (Rabat, begun 1191) were designed as a set — three minarets for three capitals across two continents. All follow the same proportional system: square shaft, internal ramp, decorative blind arcading. The Giralda is the tallest survivor. The Hassan Tower is the grandest unfinished project. The Kutubiyya is the prototype that generated both.</p>

              <p>Scholar Felix Arnold observed that under the Almohads, construction reached a scale unseen since the Romans. Rammed earth and brick were their primary materials — cheap, available, and fast. They refined manufacturing processes that allowed them to build an entire city wall in months. The Marrakech ramparts — 19 kilometres — went up in eight months (though under the Almoravids). The Almohads replicated this speed across an empire.</p>

              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>Austerity as ideology</p>
              <p>Ibn Tumart founded the Almohad movement on religious reform — the rejection of Almoravid decadence. This translated directly into architecture. Early Almohad buildings stripped back the ornamental excess of the Almoravid period, replacing intricate surface decoration with bold proportions and deliberate emptiness. The balance between carved stone and bare wall became itself a statement of faith. Later Almohad buildings — particularly under al-Mansur — gradually reintroduced ornament, but always within this framework of restraint.</p>

              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The gate trilogy</p>
              <p>Bab Agnaou (Marrakech), Bab Oudaia (Rabat), and Bab er-Rouah (Rabat) are three variations on a single theme: a monumental horseshoe arch framed by concentric decorative bands, with shell motifs filling the spandrels and Quranic inscriptions in Kufic script running along the outer frame. The bent interior passage — forcing a 90-degree turn — is both defensive and psychological: you enter the caliph&apos;s domain by submitting to his architecture.</p>
