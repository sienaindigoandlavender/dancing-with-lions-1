    description: '13 kilometres separate Morocco from Spain at the Strait\'s narrowest point. Migrants cross by small boats (pateras), rubber dinghies, jet skis, or by swimming. This route also includes overland crossings into the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.',
    origin: 'Sub-Saharan West and Central Africa (Guinea, Côte d\'Ivoire, Mali, Cameroon, Senegal, DRC) via internal African routes through Mauritania, Mali, Niger, or Algeria',
    entry: 'Oujda (from Algeria, eastern border) or through Mauritania and up the Atlantic coast',
    path: 'Oujda → Nador (Melilla fence) or Tetouan/Fnideq (Ceuta fence) or Tangier (Strait of Gibraltar by sea)',
    destination: 'Spain (mainland via Strait, or Ceuta/Melilla enclaves)',
    distance: '~13 km sea crossing at the Strait. The fence at Melilla: three barriers of 6m, 3m, and 6m height over 7.5 miles',
    dangers: 'Drowning in the Strait (2,000–4,000 died between 1991–1996 alone). Violence at fence crossings. Razor wire. Tear gas. Security force beatings. Pushbacks. Hypothermia in winter sea crossings',
    status: 'In 2018, 56,000+ reached Spain via this route — the year\'s most active route. Morocco prevents 45,000+ crossings in 2024. Since the 2022 Melilla massacre, overland crossings have decreased; more attempt sea routes or redirect via Algeria to Tunisia.',

From West African coastal countries or Morocco\'s Atlantic coast, migrants sail toward the Spanish Canary Islands — 100 km off the African coast — or attempt the longer crossing to mainland Spain. In 2024, this became the most active passageage from Africa to Europe.',

    dangers: 'Open ocean. 10,457 dead or missing on this route in 2024 — a record. Overcrowded wooden boats (cayucos/pirogues). Dehydration, exposure, engine failure. Bodies seldom recovered',
    status: '36,000 intercepted in 2024 — the busiest route that year. Increased 18% while other routes decreased. Mali was leading country of origin (~16,500). The shift reflects intensified EU-funded interdiction along the Mediterranean.',

    dangers: 'Desert heat and dehydration. Banditry. Exploitation by smugglers. Costs of thousands of euros for people earning <€1/day. Deportations back to Algeria. Migrants report being deported to Oujda region 30+ times over a decade',

    destination: 'Morocco (transit) → Canary Islands or northern Morocco',
    distance: 'Senegal to Tangier via Mauritania: ~4,000 km',
