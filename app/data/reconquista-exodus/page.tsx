          In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella completed the longest military campaign in
          European history — 770 years to reclaim a peninsula that was conquered in seven.
          Then, in the same year, they signed the Alhambra Decree: convert or leave.
          The Jews went first. The Muslims followed, in waves, over the next 122 years.
          By 1614, Spain had emptied itself of the communities that had built its libraries,
          its palaces, its irrigation systems, and its economy. They scattered across the
          Mediterranean — to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, Amsterdam,
          Livorno. They carried with them the DNA of al-Andalus. This module maps where
          they went, and what they brought.

The completion of the Reconquista, the beginning of the Jewish diaspora, and the launch of the colonial project all happen in the same calendar year, ordered by the same monarchs. Columbus\'s crew included conversos. His voyage was partly motivated by a desire to find allies against Islam and fund a new crusade for Jerusalem. 1492 is not three separate stories. It is one.</p>

Bayezid sent ships to bring refugees from Spain. They brought the printing press, commercial expertise, diplomatic languages, and medical knowledge. Thessaloniki became a majority-Jewish city — the only one in Europe — and remained so for 450 years.</p>

Jews expelled by the Alhambra Decree: estimated 40,000–200,000 (figures remain debated). Moriscos expelled 1609–1614: 275,000–300,000. Of those, approximately 70,000–100,000 settled in Morocco. The economic devastation was immediate: Valencia lost a third of its population. Agricultural knowledge walked out the door.</p>
