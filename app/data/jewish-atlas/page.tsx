  { year: -500, title: 'Ancient Origins', story: 'Jewish traders and settlers arrive in North Africa, possibly as early as the 6th century BCE. Some traditions link Moroccan Jewish presence to the destruction of the First Temple (586 BCE). By the Roman period, Jewish communities exist across Mauretania Tingitana. Some scholars believe Amazigh tribes converted to Judaism — the origin of the "Berber Jews" of the Atlas and Saharan fringe.', keyFact: '2,500+ years of continuous presence.' },
  { year: 70, title: 'After the Temple', story: 'The destruction of the Second Temple by Rome in 70 CE sends waves of Jewish refugees across the Mediterranean. Some settle in Morocco, joining existing communities. By this time, Jewish presence is documented in Volubilis. These early communities — speakers of Amazigh and later Arabic — become the Toshavim: the indigenous Jews of Morocco.', keyFact: 'Toshavim: "residents." They were there first.' },
  { year: 788, title: 'Idrisid Foundation', story: 'When Idris I founds Fes, a Jewish community settles in the new city from the beginning. Jews participate in trade, crafts, and diplomacy. Under successive dynasties — Almoravid, Almohad, Marinid — Jewish fortunes rise and fall. The Almohad period (1147–1269) is the most oppressive: forced conversions, destruction of synagogues.', keyFact: 'Jews present in Fes from its founding.' },
  { year: 1391, title: 'First Iberian Refugees', story: 'Anti-Jewish pogroms sweep Spain. Massacres in Seville, Córdoba, Toledo. Thousands of Jews flee south across the Strait. They bring Spanish language, Sephardic liturgy, and commercial expertise. This is the first major wave of Megorashim — "exiles" — arriving in Morocco.', keyFact: 'The Megorashim arrive: a new community within a community.' },
  { year: 1438, title: 'First Mellah (Fes)', story: 'Sultan Abu Sa\'id Uthman III creates the first mellah — a walled Jewish quarter — in Fes. Located near the royal palace, ostensibly for protection. The word "mellah" derives from the Arabic for "salt" — the marshy, saline area where the quarter was built. Not a European ghetto: Jews had their own markets, synagogues, cemeteries, and governance. But it was still segregation.', keyFact: 'Mellah: not a ghetto, but not freedom either.' },
  { year: 1492, title: 'The Great Expulsion', story: 'The Alhambra Decree. An estimated 50,000 Jews cross to Morocco. Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Wattasi officially welcomes them, but conditions are brutal. Bands of robbers attack refugees on the roads to Fes. Twenty thousand die from famine and disease camping in fields outside the city. The Megorashim arrive with wealth, Spanish language, European commercial skills — and profound trauma.', keyFact: '~50,000 arrive. ~20,000 die on the road or in fields.' },
  { year: 1500, endYear: 1700, title: 'Two Communities, One Quarter', story: 'The Toshavim and Megorashim live side by side but remain distinct. Separate synagogues. Separate burial grounds. Different marriage contracts (ketubot). Different languages: Toshavim speak Arabic and Amazigh. Megorashim speak Haketia (Judeo-Spanish). The Megorashim gradually dominate — their scholarly and mercantile elite status gives them political access to the sultan\'s court.', keyFact: 'Separate synagogues for 300 years.' },
  { year: 1557, title: 'Shmuel Palache & Diplomacy', story: 'Jewish diplomats become crucial intermediaries between Morocco and Europe. The Palache family of Fes negotiates the 1610 Morocco-Netherlands treaty. Shmuel Palache — rabbi, merchant, diplomat, privateer — personifies the Moroccan Jewish role as bridge between civilizations. Jews serve as Tujjar as-Sultan (merchants of the Sultan), handling long-distance trade.', keyFact: 'Jewish diplomats brokered Morocco\'s first European treaty.' },
  { year: 1672, endYear: 1727, title: 'Moulay Ismail\'s Meknes', story: 'The Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail moves the capital to Meknes and creates a new mellah there (1682). Jewish artisans — especially metalworkers, silversmiths, and tailors — are essential to the imperial project. Some hold senior administrative positions. But the relationship is transactional: Jewish ministers serve at the sultan\'s pleasure and can be dismissed instantly.', keyFact: 'Third mellah in Morocco, built for imperial ambition.' },
  { year: 1764, title: 'Essaouira: The Mogador Experiment', story: 'Sultan Mohammed III founds Essaouira (Mogador) and invites Jewish merchants specifically to develop Atlantic trade with Europe. The Jewish community becomes the economic engine of the port. Jewish traders control much of Morocco\'s maritime commerce. The mellah of Essaouira — one of the largest — becomes a center of Sephardic culture. By the 1800s, it\'s the country\'s most cosmopolitan city.', keyFact: 'A sultan built a city around its Jewish merchants.' },
  { year: 1862, title: 'Alliance Israélite Universelle', story: 'The Alliance Israélite Universelle opens its first Moroccan school in Tetouan. French-language education transforms Jewish communities. Within decades, Moroccan Jews speak French alongside Arabic, Amazigh, Haketia, and Hebrew. The schools create a French-educated elite that will play a decisive role in the colonial period — and in the eventual emigration.', keyFact: 'French education: the door that opened, then pushed people through.' },
  { year: 1912, endYear: 1956, title: 'The Protectorate', story: 'Under French and Spanish protectorates, Jews gain legal equality for the first time. Affluent Jews move out of mellahs into European-planned Villes Nouvelles. But the Vichy period (1940–1944) brings anti-Jewish laws. Mohammed V reportedly refuses to hand over Moroccan Jews to the Nazis — a story that has become central to Moroccan national identity, though its details are debated by historians.', keyFact: 'Mohammed V: "There are no Jews in Morocco, only Moroccan citizens."' },
  { year: 1948, endYear: 1967, title: 'The Great Departure', story: 'Israel is established in 1948. Over the next two decades, the vast majority of Morocco\'s 250,000–300,000 Jews emigrate — to Israel (Operation Yachin, semi-covert Mossad program), to France, Canada, and the Americas. Some leave for Zionist conviction. Some flee rising tensions after Arab-Israeli wars. Some are pushed by economic changes. By 1971, fewer than 35,000 remain.', keyFact: '250,000 → 35,000 in two decades.' },

The Museum of Moroccan Judaism in Casablanca is the only Jewish museum in the Arab world. Bayt Dakira (House of Memory) opened in Essaouira. King Mohammed VI has invested in restoring Jewish heritage sites. Tens of thousands of Jewish Moroccans visit annually for hiloula (saint pilgrimage) festivals.

          Two Jewish communities shared Morocco for centuries but were not the same people.
          The <strong>Toshavim</strong> — "residents" — were there first. Amazigh-speaking,
          Arabic-speaking, present since antiquity. Some lived in the Atlas Mountains and the
          Saharan fringe. The <strong>Megorashim</strong> — "exiles" — arrived from Spain

          commerce. They worshipped in separate synagogues. Were buried in separate cemeteries.
          Maintained separate marriage contracts for 300 years. Only in the 18th century did
          the two communities blend — and even then, not everywhere. At their peak in the

              <p>Most accounts of Moroccan Jews treat them as one community. They were not. The Toshavim were indigenous — present for millennia, speaking Amazigh and Arabic, practicing their own liturgy. The Megorashim arrived from Spain bearing a different language (Haketia), different rituals (Sephardic), different commercial skills (European trade networks), and a different social status (often wealthy, always educated). They worshipped separately for 300 years. Their surnames still tell the story: Toledano (from Toledo), Corcos (from Cáceres), Assouline (Amazigh: "from rock").</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The mellah</p>
              <p>Not a European ghetto. The mellah was placed near the royal palace — proximity to power, not exile from it. Jews had their own markets, courts, synagogues, and governance. But it was still a walled quarter with gates that closed at night. The first was created in Fes in 1438. By the 19th century, most Moroccan cities had one. The word itself comes from the Arabic for salt — the saline, marshy land where the Fes quarter was built.</p>

              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The Berber Jews</p>
              <p>In the Atlas Mountains, the Anti-Atlas, and the Saharan fringe, Jewish communities lived in rural villages, spoke Amazigh, and maintained traditions that predated both the Sephardic and the urban Arabic-speaking communities. The cemetery at Ifrane (Anti-Atlas) may contain tombstones from the 2nd century CE. These were not city merchants — they were farmers, herders, and village artisans. Their traditions were the most archaic and the least documented.</p>

              <p className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider mb-1" style={{ color: C.ink }}>The disappearance</p>
              <p>In 1945, there were 300,000 Jews in Morocco. By 1971, there were 35,000. Today, approximately 2,500. The reasons are multiple and contested: Zionist conviction, Operation Yachin (semi-covert Israeli emigration program), rising Arab-Israeli tensions, economic restructuring, the pull of France and Canada. The departure was not a single event but a generation-long hemorrhage. What remains are cemeteries, synagogues (some restored, some crumbling), and tens of thousands of diaspora visitors who return each year for hiloula — the anniversary celebrations at the tombs of rabbi-saints.</p>
