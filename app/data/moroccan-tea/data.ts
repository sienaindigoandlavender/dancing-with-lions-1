  { name: 'Gunpowder green tea', arabic: 'اتاي / atay', origin: 'Zhejiang Province, China', detail: 'Chinese green tea rolled into small pellets resembling gunpowder — "Zhu cha" (pearl tea) in Chinese. Strong, slightly astringent, full-bodied. The smaller and shinier the pellets, the higher the quality. Morocco imports ~60,000 tonnes annually from China, 95% from Zhejiang Province, with Shaoxing supplying half. Morocco absorbs 46% of China\'s gunpowder exports and 16% of all Chinese tea exports. The country does not produce its own tea.', color: '#22C55E' },
  { name: 'Mint (Nanah)', arabic: 'نعناع / na\'na\'', origin: 'Morocco — grown domestically', detail: 'Spearmint (Mentha spicata), called "nanah" in Darija. Sweeter and milder than peppermint. Most Moroccans grow their own rather than buying it. Commercially insignificant but aromatically essential — the dominant flavour of the drink. Hides the slight bitterness of the relatively low-quality green tea. Regional variations: flio (pennyroyal) in some areas, chiba (wormwood/absinthe) in the south, sage or verbena in winter, sometimes saffron.', color: '#16A34A' },
  { name: 'Sugar', arabic: 'سكر / sukkar', origin: 'Imported — historically French colonial supply', detail: 'Traditionally sold in large hard cones (pain de sucre), broken by hand. Moroccans add generously: 6–8 teaspoons per pot is normal. Sugar consumption deepened under the French Protectorate (1912–1956), which made it cheap and widely available to serve French commercial interests. Sugar rounds off mint\'s sweetness and brings out its aromatic compounds. The combination of foreign tea, local mint, and colonial sugar is the drink itself.', color: '#F59E0B' },

  { step: 3, name: 'The Marriage', detail: 'The spirit is returned to the pot. Fresh mint stuffed in generously — the leaves must permeate the infusion. Sugar added directly to the pot. Remaining boiling water fills it.', duration: '—' },
  { step: 4, name: 'The Steep', detail: 'Pot placed on low heat. The tea, mint, and sugar fuse. Moroccan atay uses boiling water — not the cooler temperatures of East Asian green tea preparation.', duration: '5 min' },
  { step: 5, name: 'The Pour', detail: 'Poured back and forth between pot and glass from a height of 30–50 cm. This aerates the liquid and produces the essential foam (rghwa). No foam means the tea is not ready. Repeat until it crowns.', duration: 'Until foam' },
  { step: 6, name: 'The Serve', detail: 'Three glasses, minimum. Served on a sinia (silver tray) in small decorated glasses. The head of the household or the most esteemed person pours. Refusing a glass is a discourtesy.', duration: '—' },
