            315,000 years. Eight dynasties. Three colonial powers. One independence.
            The bones at Jebel Irhoud have modern faces and ancient braincases —
            human enough to recognise, old enough to humble. Every empire that
            followed built on what the last one left behind: Roman columns became
            minaret foundations, Almohad walls became Marinid madrasas, colonial
            Ville Nouvelles grew beside medinas that predated them by a thousand
            years. Morocco is not a country with layers. It is the layers.
