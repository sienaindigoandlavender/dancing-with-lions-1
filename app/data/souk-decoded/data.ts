  { rule: 'Noisy trades away from textiles', explanation: 'Metalworkers (haddadine) were separated from fabric and carpet sellers. Hammering and weaving don\'t mix.' },

  { rule: 'The kissaria is the inner sanctum', explanation: 'The covered, lockable kissaria housed luxury goods — fabrics, jewelry, perfume. Locked at night. The safest, most controlled part of the souk.' },
