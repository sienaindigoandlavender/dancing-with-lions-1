Typed pages covered his floor with dirty footprints on them. Kerouac and Ginsberg arrived in 1957 to help assemble the manuscript. Burroughs reinvented Tangier\'s International Zone as "Interzone" — a liminal nowhere-space that became one of the most influential concepts in postwar literature.',

Became a schoolteacher, then a writer. For Bread Alone — dictated to Bowles in Spanish, translated into English — was banned in Morocco and across the Arab world for its unflinching depiction of poverty, sex, and survival.

His tales capture Tangier street life with dark humor and supernatural elements — jinn, sorcery, desire, betrayal. His work represents some of the only Moroccan literature composed in Darija rather than fusha or French.',
