              Moroccan cities are coloured by what lies beneath them. Marrakech is red because
              the Haouz plain is red. Fes tiles are earth-toned because the Saïss basin provides
              specific clays. Essaouira is white because the Atlantic coast is limestone.
              Before branding, before municipal codes, before Instagram — geology was the stylist.

              Chefchaouen&apos;s blue came from Jewish refugees. Essaouira&apos;s Portuguese fortifications brought
              European whitewash. Fes&apos;s Andalusian quarter carries design patterns from Córdoba and
              Granada. Morocco&apos;s most famous colours arrived with people who were forced to leave somewhere else.
              The palette is a map of displacement.

              Tadelakt is saponification — soap-making inside a wall. Zellige glazing is controlled
              oxidation of metal compounds at precise temperatures. Indigo dyeing is a fermentation
              process. Moroccan artisans were practicing industrial chemistry centuries before the
              periodic table existed. They just called it craft.
