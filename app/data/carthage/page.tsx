            dock 220 warships, whose traders reached West Africa and Britain, and whose agricultural
            knowledge was so advanced that Rome translated its books before burning its libraries.
            Destroyed so completely in 146 BCE that the Romans debated whether to let it exist at all.
            Then rebuilt by Julius Caesar into the second-largest city of the western Roman Empire.
            Then became the intellectual capital of early Christianity — where the Biblical canon
            was confirmed and Augustine came of age. Then conquered by Vandals. Then by Byzantines.
            Then destroyed a final time by Arab armies in 698 CE. Today it is a wealthy residential
            suburb of Tunis with scattered ruins where elephants and senators once walked.

            <p className="text-[13px] leading-relaxed" style={{ color: C.text }}>
              The founding legend of Carthage is a story about intelligence defeating power.
              Dido asks for "as much land as an ox hide can cover" — a seemingly modest request.
              Then she cuts the hide into strips thin enough to encircle an entire hill. The Phoenicians
              called it Byrsa — which sounds like their word for "citadel" but may also echo the
              Greek byrsa, "ox hide." Whether history or myth, the story encodes the Carthaginian
              identity: wealth through cleverness, empire through trade, victory through the mind.

            <p className="text-[13px] leading-relaxed" style={{ color: C.text }}>
              Almost nothing survives of Carthaginian literature. When Rome destroyed the city
              in 146 BCE, its libraries were either given to Numidian kings or burned. Only one
              work was deliberately preserved: Mago's 28 books on agriculture, translated into
              Latin and Greek because the Romans recognised its superior knowledge. This is the
              paradox of Carthage — a civilisation that contributed serial production, uncoloured
              glass, the threshing board, and the cothon harbour to human progress, known almost
              entirely through the words of the people who destroyed it.

            <p className="text-[13px] leading-relaxed" style={{ color: C.text }}>
              The Council of Carthage in 397 CE confirmed which books constitute the Bible as
              the Western Church knows it. Tertullian invented the Latin word for the Trinity
              here. Perpetua wrote one of the earliest women's texts in Christendom in a Carthaginian
              prison. Augustine — arguably the most influential Christian thinker after Paul —
              came of age in this city. North Africa was not peripheral to Christianity. It was
              the intellectual engine.
