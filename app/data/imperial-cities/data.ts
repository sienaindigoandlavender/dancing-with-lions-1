The Almohads conquered it in 1147, destroyed Almoravid monuments, and built the Koutoubia Mosque — whose 77m minaret became the template for the Giralda in Seville and Hassan Tower in Rabat. Under the Saadian Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur al-Dhahabi ("The Golden"), Marrakech experienced a second golden age: El Badi Palace, the Saadian Tombs, and control of the Timbuktu gold routes. The 12th-century walls — made of red clay pisé — give the city its iconic colour and nickname. Jemaa el-Fna transforms from market to carnival nightly: storytellers, musicians, food vendors. Winston Churchill called Marrakech "Paris of the Sahara."',

He built over 40 km of walls (15m high), massive palaces, gardens, the legendary royal stables designed for 12,000 horses with underground granaries and an ingenious water-cooling system, and the Agdal Basin. His reign lasted 55 years — the longest of any Moroccan sultan. After his death, his sons fought for succession, and the capital moved to Fez, then Rabat. Meknès never regained its imperial status but retains the monumental scale of Ismail\'s ambition. Sits on the fertile Saïss Plain — known today as Morocco\'s agricultural capital. Nearby Volubilis preserves Roman-era ruins (UNESCO, 1997).',

    detail: 'The political capital. The Almohads built it as a ribat (fortified monastery) for launching campaigns into Iberia. Yaqub al-Mansur — fresh from victory at the Battle of Alarcos (1195) — began construction of what would have been the world\'s largest mosque. He died before completion. The unfinished Hassan Tower (44m of a planned 86m) and 200 remaining columns still stand as Morocco\'s most poignant monument. Morisco refugees from Spain settled here after 1609, building the Andalusian Wall. The French chose Rabat as administrative capital in 1912, and it remained the capital at independence (1956). Today it houses the Royal Palace, all foreign embassies, and Morocco\'s parliament. The 2012 UNESCO inscription uniquely recognises both the historic and modern city — from Almohad fortress to Art Deco Ville Nouvelle.',
